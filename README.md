This library is a drop-in replacement for the old WXTiles Javascript API.

**Note:** The only difference is that you must use a valid `apikey`. The examples included here require
that the `apikey` variable is changed from `undefined` to this value (string) in both the Google Maps and OpenLayers examples.

WXTiles API keys can be obtained from the [WXTiles website](https://wxtiles.com/). Once you have registered and logged in, you will find it on the ["My Account" page](https://wxtiles.com/my-account/).
